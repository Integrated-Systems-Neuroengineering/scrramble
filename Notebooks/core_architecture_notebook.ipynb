    "# Goals of this notebook\n",
    "- Build flax.linen or flax.nnx modules for the EPIC-EIC architecture.\n",
    "- This involves making modules for the core with trainable weights, slots with inputs, and lookup tables (LUTs) with non-trainable inter-core connectivity $\\{-1, 0, 1\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summarizing the Connectivity patterns\n",
    "\n",
    "We have the following:\n",
    "1. rows and columns\n",
    "2. cores\n",
    "3. i/o slots\n",
    "4. neighbors to all the cores\n",
    "5. per slot there are neurons. Does that mean that the neurons only exist at the slots?\n",
    "\n",
    "## Connectivity pattern\n",
    "1. Cores that share a row and/or a column are connected. Tensor $C$ specifies these cores.\n",
    "   1. e.g. $C[1, 1, 1, 2]$ represents if the cores present on row 1, col 1 and row 1, col 2 are connected. They are!\n",
    "2. Each core has some number of neighbors. This number depends on perhaps where the core is located -- centrally located cored will have more neighbors.\n",
    "   1. The tensor $N$ contains this info. It contains a linearly intexed list (0 to num_cores-1) and number of neighbors it has.\n",
    "   2. e.g. $N[3, 2] = 2$ represents that there are $3$ cores with exactly $2$ neighbors.\n",
    "3. The tensor $S$ determines how the cores can talk to each other. It describes how the slots are connected\n",
    "   1. $S$ specifices how a core at a given row and column is connected to one of its neighbors through which i/o slots\n",
    "   2. e.g. $S[1, 2, 3, 4, 1] = 1$ would imply that the core sitting at row 1, column 2, is connected to its neighbor #4, at the input slot #3 via its output slot #1 (verify this with Johannes). The 1 represents that such a connection exists.\n",
    "4. Finally $W$ is the tensor containing all the weights. To find a weight between two neuron.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Modules needed\n",
    "1. Core module: with $256 \\times 256$ weights.\n",
    "2. Input Slot module: can accept a signed input vector. Each core should have 4 of these\n",
    "3. Output slot module: vector - matrix multiplication ($64 \\times 64$ weight $64 \\times 1$ input vector) -- Not sure if this needs to be imp,emented explicitly!\n",
    "4. Slot LUT module: For each input module, determine which core can send inputs.\n",
    "5. External input module: Module that can provide external inputs to the cores. -- Does this need to be included in the Input Slot module\n",
    "\n",
    "## Design\n",
    "1. Make a module for the core. For every core initialize $256 \\times 256$ weights. Each core should receive an input vector that is $256$ elements wide. This vector is stitched together from inputs from previous layer or external inputs.\n",
    "2. Make a module for slots... TBD"
